## Outcome

- Used **Express** and **PostgreSQL** to build a webpage where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
-  It allows users to create and delete letters, providing a simple interface for communication.
- Used **Git** and **GitHub** for project management, and **Netlify** to deploy it.
- Tried to maintain **clean code**.

## What I learned

- Deeper understanding of Express and PostgreSQL.
- Dealing with error handling.
- Every component has been **tested**.
